This project aims to visually illustrate the concept of plate tectonics through an interactive animation created with HTML and CSS. By utilizing these web technologies, the project provides an engaging and educational way to understand the movement of tectonic plates.

### Features

- **HTML**: The animation's structural elements are built using HTML, forming the basis for the visual representation of the tectonic plate movements.
